			- "publisher" and "data_preparer" can be up to 128 characters long
			  and can additionally contain spaces and some special characters.
			- "copyright" should be a path to a file on the disc, even one that
			  does not exist (but in practice it can be set to anything).

			"system" and "application" must always be set to "PLAYSTATION" in
			order for the disc to be recognized as valid.

			You may optionally include a license file using the <license> tag.
			Some consoles, particularly Japanese or PAL models with a modchip,
			require the disc to contain valid license data and will refuse to
			boot if it is missing. License files are usually not required on
			US consoles or when booting via softmods or cheat cartridges.

			License files are region-specific and are not distributed with
			PSn00bSDK for obvious reasons, but can be dumped from an official
			game using dumpsxiso or extracted from the Sony SDK.

			Files and directories can be added to the disc by placing <file>
			and <dir> tags below. All file names are case-insensitive and must
			be in 8.3 format, i.e. no more than 8 characters for the name and 3
			for the optional extension. Directories cannot have extensions.

			A boot configuration file (SYSTEM.CNF) or executable (PSX.EXE) must
			be present in the root directory. Due to BIOS limitations the root
			directory cannot hold more than 30 files or directories, and the
			entire disc must contain 45 directories or less. Subdirectories can
			contain any number of files.
