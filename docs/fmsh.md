## Model File (.msh)
This file contains a model with a certain amount of submeshes. Submeshes could be used for things like level sections, or different variations of models
| Type    | Name               | Description                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| char[4] | file_magic         | File identifier magic, always "FMSH"                                          |
| u32     | n_submeshes        | Number of submeshes in this model.                                            |
| u32     | offset_mesh_desc   | Offset into the binary section to the start of the array of MeshDesc structs. |
| u32     | offset_vertex_data | Offset into the binary section to the start of the raw VertexPSX data.        |
| u32     | offset_mesh_names  | Offset into the binary section to the start of the mesh name table.           |

All offsets are relative to the start of this binary section.

| u8   | (...)         | In the first vertex, this is an index into the texture collection, which determines which texture to use. In the second vertex, this indicates the size of the triangle, which is used to determine from what distance to tessellate a polygon. This value does not have a fixed unit.|
